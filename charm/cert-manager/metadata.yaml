summary: Issue and manage certificates and keys for private self-signed CAs
maintainer: Casey Marshall <casey.marshall@canonical.com>
description: |-
  Manage client and server certificates that are issued by the self-signed
  CA deployed with the easyrsa charm. Relates to easyrsa and allows creation
  of client and server certificates that can be used with external systems.
  
  This charm can be used to issue certificates for clients that need to connect
  to a Kafka cluster secured with easyrsa, for example.
  
  This charm is not intended to function as a CA root on the public internet.
  For public TLS endpoint security, Let's Encrypt / certbot should be used
  instead.
